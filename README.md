# BookingCare ReactJS

## Overview

BookingCare ReactJS is a front-end web application designed to streamline healthcare appointment scheduling and management. Users can book medical appointments, manage patient profiles, and handle doctor-related information efficiently. Built with **ReactJS** and utilizing **Redux** for state management, the application provides a robust and scalable user interface for a seamless experience.

This project serves as the front-end component of the BookingCare platform, designed to integrate with a backend service (details to be provided).

## Features

- **Appointment Booking**: Enables users to schedule medical appointments with ease.
- **Patient Management**: Tools for creating, updating, and managing patient profiles.
- **Doctor Management**: Functionality to handle doctor profiles and schedules.
- **State Management**: Leverages Redux for efficient and predictable state handling.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with Create React App for modular development and maintenance.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed before setting up the project:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **npm** (version 6.x or higher) or **yarn** (optional)
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nini048/booking-care-reactjs.git
   cd booking-care-reactjs
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```
3. **Start the development server:**
```bash
npm start
```
The application will run in development mode at http://localhost:3000. The page will reload automatically upon code changes, and lint errors will appear in the console.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- **npm start:** Launches the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
- **npm test:** Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode. See the Create React App documentation for details.
- **npm run build:** Builds the application for production, outputting optimized files to the build folder. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for cache busting. Refer to the deployment guide for more information.
- **npm run eject:** Warning: This is a one-way operation. It removes the single build dependency, copying configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into the project for full customization. Use this only if you need complete control over build tools.

## Project Structure
The project is bootstrapped with Create React App, following a standard structure:
```bash

```

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: For predictable state management across the application.
- **Create React App**: Toolchain for setting up and managing React projects.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For modern JavaScript features and functionality.
